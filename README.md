# Final Project
Our game is a shooter with several enemies, with a space theme, that's why we focus on how it could be. For this we propose the use of a UML that will evolve according to the needs of the project, besides that as the arcade library allows to place music files, we thought of placing original compositions of a member of our team, which was placed a sample in the following section. The goal is to create an entertaining and original game, with our own material. In addition to certain inclusions to generate more curiosity.
